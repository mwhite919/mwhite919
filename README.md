<h3>Hi there, I'm MichelleðŸ‘‹</h3>

With diverse experiences across industries, I've found my passion in frontend development, where crafting efficient code is my motivation. Outside the digital realm, I'm deeply connected to movement and rhythm, often immersing myself in Amapiano beats while coding or perfecting choreographies at dance festivals.
Having previously served as a mindset coach, self-development and cultivating a positive outlook are ingrained in my DNA. I'm perpetually seeking avenues for personal and professional growth, eager to explore new horizons and evolve as both a coder and an individual.
When I'm not coding or dancing, I'm experimenting with culinary creations from around the globe, appreciating the joy of shared meals with friends. âœ¨
