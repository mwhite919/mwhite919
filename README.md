Hi there, I'm MichelleðŸ‘‹

With diverse experiences across industries, I've found my passion in frontend development, where crafting clean, efficient code is my forte. Outside the digital realm, I'm deeply connected to movement and rhythm, often immersing myself in Amapiano beats while coding or perfecting choreographies at dance festivals.
Having previously served as a mindset coach, self-development and cultivating a positive outlook are ingrained in my DNA. I'm perpetually seeking avenues for personal and professional growth, eager to explore new horizons and evolve as both a coder and an individual.
When I'm not coding or dancing, I'm experimenting with culinary creations from around the globe, appreciating the joy of shared meals with friends. âœ¨ 

-âš¡ I have an international background as I am from the US but have lived abroad for the past 8 years (Asia, South America, Europe)
-ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Crypto Application
